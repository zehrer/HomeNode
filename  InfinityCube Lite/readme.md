Key changes
- 

The main problem of the current systems are ..
- not very user friendly if you run OpenSource (e.g. Home Assistant, MQTT)
- Matter as a big standard cover only the common denominators
- each company provide a dedicated app


The maint target here is not to deliver again another planform, the ideas are
- close the gaps on existing platform
- provide simple open source solution (e.g. for a smart light in a bag you don't need a full Matter support)
- provide and overview what is existing and how this could be reused as much as possible.
- look in the future and use AI (e.g.  W3C Web of Things )
